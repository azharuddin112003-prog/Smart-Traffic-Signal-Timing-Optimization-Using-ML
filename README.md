# Smart-Traffic-Signal-Timing-Optimization-Using-ML
Smart Traffic Signal Timing Optimization is an ML-powered system designed to intelligently adjust traffic light green signal duration based on real-time traffic conditions. The system predicts the optimal green signal time by analyzing factors such as the number of vehicles, peak hour status, and weather conditions (rain).
